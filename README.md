## The First Project

The first project is my attempt to edit the provided code to add accessibility features to the provided code.

- The primary objective was to show evidence of knowledge regarding adding image descriptions.
- I completed this task to reinforce the image description skills with repition which is a great practice for reinforcing the skills learned in class.
- Image descriptions are helpful for those who cannot see the intended image.
- I was able to learn how to scan through the html code to look for the parts of the code that I need to edit.
- This is my first attempt at editing code and I feel I learned a lot about layout and the effects of one change in HTML and CSS on the entire webpage.
- I realized through this project how challenging it is to have an entire page with rather vague instructions rather than a small piece of code you are tasked with editing.
